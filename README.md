# AlibreX Portable Bin Directory Checker

This utility is designed to ensure the AlibreX Portable Bin directory is correctly set up and operational by interfacing with the Alibre CAD software. It verifies the setup by attempting to open a specific file (`test.AD_PRT`) within the application's environment.

## Features

- Initializes the AlibreX automation hook.
- Opens a CAD file to check if the AlibreX environment is properly configured.
- Outputs the application title, file path, and session name to the console for verification.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework (Version specified by your development environment)
- AlibreX software installed and configured on the host machine.

## Installation

No specific installation steps are required beyond ensuring that AlibreX software is properly installed and that this utility is placed in a directory that has access to the necessary AlibreX assemblies.

## Usage

1. Place the `test.AD_PRT` file in the executable's directory, or modify the file path in the code to point to its location.
2. Run the application from a command prompt or through your IDE.

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. Observe the console output. If the utility has started successfully, it will display the AlibreX application title, the path of the opened file, and the session name.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the AlibreX assemblies are accessible to the application. This might involve adjusting the assembly references within your project settings.
- Verify that the `test.AD_PRT` file exists in the specified directory.
